# Time & Space Complexity
Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.<br>
Types of notations<br>
1. **O-notation**: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-oh of g of n”. It is also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which the algorithm terminates. 
2. **Ω-notation**: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-omega of g of n”. It is also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound in which the algorithm terminates. 
3. **𝚯-notation**: It is used to denote the average time of a program. <br>

**Example**
```
int a = 0;
for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
    a += 1;
}
```
Linear Time Complexity = O(n) <br>

It follows the following order in case of time complexity: 

`O(nn) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1)` <br>

*Note*: Reverse is the order for better performance of a code with corresponding time complexity, i.e. a program with less time complexity is more efficient. <br>

**Space Complexity**<br>

`Space complexity` of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input. It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time.<br>

For example: int consumes 4 bytes of memory.
